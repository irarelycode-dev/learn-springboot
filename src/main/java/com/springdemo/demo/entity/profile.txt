Cloud based social interaction platform with restrictions using sentimental analysis and NLP techniquesCloud based social interaction platform with restrictions using sentimental analysis and NLP techniques
Jun 2019 - Nov 2019Jun 2019 - Nov 2019

Associated with Vel Tech Technical UniversityAssociated with Vel Tech Technical University
An interaction portal,more like Quora or stackoverflow , which allows multiple users to interact with each other by tagging the concerned user,that can viewed by all the other users whoever follows that concerned user.There exists no privacy and this system can be used in educational and governmental organizations,thus increasing the transparency among the users. To restrict the users from commenting vulgar and to maintain the community guidelines,users' comments are filtered dynamically using sentimental analysis and natural language processing algorithms(NLP).Following are the technologies used:
Flask for backend
HTML5,CSS3,BS4 for frontend
sqlite for Database
Natural language toolkit(NLTK,python)
Heroku cloud for deploying
